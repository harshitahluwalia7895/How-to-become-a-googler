About this Dataset
### Context
There is a question in our mind that which language, skills, and experience should we add to our toolbox for getting a job in Google. Well, I think why not we find out the answer by analyzing the Google Jobs Site. Google published all of their jobs at https://careers.google.com/. So I scraped all of the job data from that site by going every job page using Selenium. I only take Job Title, Job Location, Job responsibilities, minimum and preferred qualifications for this dataset.
